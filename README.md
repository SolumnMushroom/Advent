# Advent
This is the Minecraft world featured in my 2020 Minecraft series.  Feel free to fork and/or download the world and show your creations to me over Twitter!
Update: I did not realize there was a 25 MB file size limit.  You can find the world in my Google Drive instead
# Usage
Simply decompress the file and place in your "saves" folder.  It should be listed as "Advent" when you start a singleplayer game.
You are free to modify this world as you see fit, however I cannot be held responsible for any damage caused to your game by downloading and using my world.
# Important note
This world is for use in <b>Java versions of Minecraft only</b>.  It likely will not work on any Bedrock version of the game.
